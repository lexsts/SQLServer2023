--The following are the best practices you should follow:

--The columns that are going to be included in the WHERE , ORDER BY , GROUP BY , and
--ON clauses of JOIN , should be a part of index key columns and hence, it is supposed
--to be covered by a covering index.

--The columns that are going to be included in the SELECT or HAVING clauses, should
--be covered in the INCLUDE section of the include index. By doing this, we can reduce
--the size of the key columns and B-Tree (Index Tree) of an index, which gives you a
--faster search
