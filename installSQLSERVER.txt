	Setup /SkipRules=Cluster_VerifyForErrors /Action=InstallFailoverCluster
*	For an advanced or enterprise installation, run the following command:   
	Setup /SkipRules=Cluster_VerifyForErrors /Action=CompleteFailoverCluster
*	If you receive this validation failure when you add a node to an existing failover installation, run the following command on each node that is being added:
