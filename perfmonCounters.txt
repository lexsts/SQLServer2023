###Perfmon to monitor CPU utilization on server
- Processor/ %Privileged Time		
	Percentage of time the processor spends on execution of Microsoft 
	Windows kernel commands such as core operating system activity 	
	and device drivers.
- Processor/ %User Time			
	percentage of time the processor spends on executing user 
	processes such as SQL Server. This includes I/O requests from SQL 
	Server
- Process (sqlservr.exe)/ %Processor Time	
	the sum of processor time on each processor for all 
	threads of the process

###Perfmon to monitor CPU utilization on instance:
- SQL Server:SQL Statistics/Auto-Param Attempts/sec
- SQL Server:SQL Statistics/Failed Auto-params/sec
- SQL Server:SQL Statistics/Batch Requests/sec
- SQL Server:SQL Statistics/SQL Compilations/sec
- SQL Server:SQL Statistics/SQL Re-Compilations/sec
- SQL Server:Plan Cache/Cache hit Ration


###Perfmon just to verify high number of recompilations
- SQLServer: SQL Statistics: SQL Compilations/Sec
- SQLServer: SQL Statistics: Auto-Param Attempts/Sec
- SQLServer: SQL Statistics: Failed Auto-Param/Sec




###Perfmon to monitor IO utilization on server
To investigating disk I/O issues, use Perfmon and spefifically the:
- Physical Disk\Disk Reads/sec
- Physical Disk\Disk Writes/sec

The key for performance is having the lowest latency possible:
- less than 10ms		= good performance
- between 10ms and 20ms		= slow performance
- between 20ms and 50ms		= poor performance
- greather than 50ms		= significant performance problem.

In addition to the performance counters, high wait times for:
- PAGEIOLATCH_*
- ASYNC_IO_COMPLETION,
- IO_COMPLETION
- WRITELOG

can signs of disk I/O bottlenecks on the server.





###Perfmon to monitor MEMORY utilization on server:
- SQL Server\ Buffer Manager\ Buffer Cache Hit Ratio
	The fact that this counter shows a 95% hit rate for buffer cache indicates nothing more than
	the fact that SQL Server is working as designed to read pages into memory before they are
	needed. (value greater than 95% for OLTP systems and greather than 90% for OLAP systems)
- SQL Server\ Buffer Manager\ Page life expectancy:
	The value of this counter reflets the Page Life Expectancy (PLE) at that exact point in time,
	and it is not uncommon to see periodic drops in the value returned by this performance counter,
	especially when a large query is executing a table scan, reading new pages into the buffer
	pool from disk. This counter must be monitored over long periods of time in order to properly
	identify normal trends. (value greater than 300 - five minutes - over a decade ago)
- SQL Server\ Buffer Manager\ Free List Stalls/sec: 
	Occur whenever a request has to wait for a free page in the buffer pool. If the number of
	stalls exceeds zero frequently or consistently over a period of time, this is a sign of
	memory pressure.
- SQL Server\ Buffer Manager\ Lazy Writes/sec:
	This counter reflects the number of buffer pages that have been flushed by the Lazy Writer
	process, outside of a normal checkpoint operation, allowing the buffer to be reused for other 
	pages. If you observe Lazy Writes occurring in conjunction with a low PLE, a low number of free
	pages, and the occurrence of Free List Stalls, this is a sign that the workload is exceeding 
	the amount of memory that is available to the buffer pool, and additional memory needs to be 
	added to the server.

- SQL Server\ Memory Manager\ Total Server Memory (KB)
- SQL Server\ Memory Manager\ Target Server Memory (KB):
	Respectively, these counters represent the total amount of memory that has been allocated by
	SQL Server and the amount of memory that SQL Server wants to commit. When the Target Server
	Memory counter exceeds the Total Server Memory counter, the SQL Server process wants to commit
	more memory than is available on the server, which can be a sign of memory pressure.
- SQL Server\ Memory Manager\ Memory Grants Outstanding:
	This counter measures the total number of processes that have successfully acquired a
	workspace memory grant. Low values for this counter, under periods of high user activity
	or heavy workload, may be a sign of memory pressure, especially if there are a high number of
	memory grants pending.
- SQL Server\ Memory Manager\ Memory Grants Pending:
	This counter measures the total number of processes that are waiting for a workspace memory 
	grant. If this is non-zero, it is a sign that tunning or optimization of the worklad should be 
	performed if possible, or that additional memory needs to be added to the server.
